# Zen and the Art of Data Maintenance
_A Proof of Concept_

Welcome to Zen! This is a program designed to help people at the beginning of their journeys into Data Science with fundamental skills to make analyses faster, easier and more robust.

In this document we will highlight some of the key focus points of the program.

This program will be predominantly delivered in python, but the key tools and techniques of the program are agnostic to choice of language, and hence can be implemented in whatever language you please!

Namely we will be focusing on:

* Data Formatting
* Data Cleaning
* Data Visualisation

For us to learn some useful techniques in data analysis, it's a good idea to first know what exactly we mean by it! This will be something we will develop more thoroughly moving forward, but a good starting place may be something like:

_The process of considering information in a robust and systematic way, in order to better understand & explain relationships._

Evidently, if we want our _data analysis_ to be useful and have significant impacts, the two most important words in this definition become "robust" and "systematic". Hence, the key goal of this program is try to build framework which allows for systematic and robust ways of thinking.

With this in mind, let us get onto the good stuff! The following sections give a flavour of the key concepts and ideas moving forward.

## Data Formatting
Data sets are like potatoes, insofar as they are both awesome and they are both full of complex structures that are useful for us as people. 

Further to the point, imagine some divine existence one day you were given the gift of some potatoes each day. Now, while this may well sound like an ideal world, the complication is that you don't know what form your potatoes may come in. You may receive your potatoes raw, boiled, roasted, fried, mashed, as chips or as wedges etc. Now don't get me wrong potatoes in all forms are brilliant, but depending on your carbohydrate-oriented needs some potatoes can be more useful than others.

Data sets in a similar way, come in all shapes, sizes and forms - or formats as we'll call them. While all brilliant are in their own right, some formats are more useful than others based on our investigative needs. There is a vast array of data formats which, when used effectively can help our investigation become more robust and systematic. 

The first key focus of this program will introduce these data formats, and help to elucidate why sometimes, roasted potatoes are better than chips but how the opposite can be true also.****

## Data Cleaning
To be addressed

## Data Visualisation
I like to think of data visualisation as a problem solving process, where I have a problem to solve and tools to solve it with. As when solving _any_ difficult, important problem there tends to be a central, over-arching problem which we look to reframe and break down into smaller, easier to solve problems!

In Data-Vis, central problem is of course "How do I communicate (insert cool fact here)". A useful reframing of this problem however may be "What visualisation tools can I use to say (cool fact)". 

Of course, in order to answer this problem we need to have a good understanding of the tool kit we have access to when solving the problem! After all, if our problem was a leaking faucet, our time would likely be wasted hitting it with a hammer if we have a perfectly good shifting spanner in our back pocket. 

As you may have deduced by now, this section of the course is going to introduce and help you understand the visualisation toolkit to help you effectively communicate your science!

Hopefully this has given you a taste of _Zen and the Art of Data Maintenance_, and we'll see you in the future!
