# Zen and the Art of Data Maintenance
_A Proof of Concept_

Welcome to Zen! This is a program designed to help people at the beginning of their journeys into Data Science with fundamental skills to make analyses faster, easier and more robust.

This program will be predominantly delivered in python, but the key tools and techniques of the program are agnostic to choice of language, and hence can be implemented in whatever language you please!

In this document we will highlight some of the key focus points of the program. Namely we will be focusing on:

* Data Formatting
* Data Cleaning
* Data Visualisation

For us to learn some useful techniques in data analysis, it's a good idea to first know what exactly we mean by it! This will be something we will develop more thoroughly moving forward, but a good starting place may be something like:
_The process of considering information in a robust and systematic way, in order to better understand & explain relationships._
<br>
Evidently, if we want our _data analysis_ to be useful and have significant impacts, the two most important words in this definition become "robust" and "systematic". Hence, the key goal of this program is try to build framework which allows for systematic and robust ways of thinking.
<br>
With this in mind, let us get onto the good stuff! The following sections give a flavour of the key concepts and ideas moving forward.

## Data Visualisation
I like to think of data visualisation as a problem solving process, where I have a problem to solve and tools to solve it with. As when solving _any_ difficult, important problem there tends to be a central, over-arching problem which we look to reframe and break down into smaller, easier to solve problems!

In Data-Vis, central problem is of course "How do I communicate <insert cool fact here>". A useful reframing of this problem however may be "What visualisation tools can I use to say <cool fact>". 

Of course, in order to answer this problem we need to have a good understanding of the tool kit we have access to when solving the problem! After all, if our problem was a leaking faucet, our time would likely be wasted hitting it with a hammer if we have a perfectly good shifting spanner in our back pocket. 

As you may have deduced by now, this section of the course is going to introduce and help you understand the visualisation toolkit to help you effectively communicate your science!
